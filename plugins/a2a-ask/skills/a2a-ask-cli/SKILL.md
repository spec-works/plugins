# A2A-Ask CLI — Talk to A2A Agents from the Command Line

A2A-Ask (`a2a-ask`) is a CLI tool that lets you interact with any remote agent implementing the [A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification/). It handles agent discovery, message sending, streaming responses, multi-turn conversations, task management, and authentication — all from the terminal.

**A2A is an open protocol** that enables AI agents to communicate with each other. Any agent that publishes an agent card and implements the A2A JSON-RPC API can be called with this tool. The CLI supports both A2A v1.0 and v0.3 agents transparently.

## Prerequisites — Installing .NET

The a2a-ask CLI requires .NET 10.0 or later.

### Windows

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.10
```

### macOS

```bash
brew install dotnet-sdk
```

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/24.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb && rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-10.0
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
dotnet --version
# Should show 10.x.x or later
```

## Installing the CLI Tool

```bash
dotnet tool install --global SpecWorks.A2A-Ask
```

Verify it works:

```bash
a2a-ask version
```

## Workflow — How to Interact with an A2A Agent

**Always follow this sequence when interacting with an A2A agent:**

### Step 1: Discover the Agent

Before sending any messages, discover the agent to understand its capabilities, skills, and security requirements.

```bash
a2a-ask discover <agent-url> --output text
```

The `<agent-url>` is the base URL of the agent endpoint. The CLI will automatically locate the agent card by:
1. Trying a GET on the URL itself (some agents return their card at their endpoint URL)
2. Falling back to `<agent-url>/.well-known/agent-card.json`

**Example:**

```bash
a2a-ask discover https://example.com/agents/my-agent --output text
```

**What to look for in the response:**
- **Name and description** — what the agent does
- **Skills** — specific capabilities the agent offers (each has an id, name, and description)
- **Capabilities** — whether streaming is supported
- **Security schemes** — what authentication is required (see Authentication section)
- **Supported interfaces** — protocol versions and bindings

If the agent card shows **no security requirements**, you can proceed directly to sending messages. If it does require auth, see the Authentication section below before proceeding.

### Step 2: Send a Message

For a simple one-shot interaction:

```bash
a2a-ask send <agent-url> -m "Your question or request here"
```

**For agents that support streaming** (check capabilities in the agent card):

```bash
a2a-ask stream <agent-url> -m "Your question or request here"
```

Streaming shows real-time progress updates and partial results as the agent works. Prefer streaming when available — it gives better visibility into what the agent is doing.

### Step 3: Handle the Response

The response will be one of these task states:

| State | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `completed` | Agent finished successfully | Read the result from the response artifacts/messages |
| `failed` | Agent encountered an error | Read the error message, adjust your request |
| `input-required` | Agent needs more information | Read the agent's question, then send a follow-up (see Multi-Turn below) |
| `auth-required` | Agent needs authentication | Obtain credentials and retry with auth options (see Authentication below) |
| `working` | Agent is still processing | Poll for status (see Polling below) |
| `canceled` | Task was canceled | No further action needed |

### Step 4: Multi-Turn Conversations

When the agent returns `input-required`, it is asking a follow-up question. The response will contain the agent's question in its message content.

**Send a follow-up using the task ID from the previous response:**

```bash
a2a-ask send <agent-url> -m "Your answer to the agent's question" --task-id <task-id-from-response>
```

You can continue this conversation loop as many times as needed. Always pass the `--task-id` to maintain conversation context.

**To group related but separate tasks into a logical session, use `--context-id`:**

```bash
a2a-ask send <agent-url> -m "First request" --context-id my-session-123
a2a-ask send <agent-url> -m "Related request" --context-id my-session-123
```

```

This reads the agent card's security schemes and runs the appropriate interactive authentication flow. The obtained token is stored for reuse.

### `a2a-ask version`

Display version information.

## Authentication

### Checking Security Requirements

When you discover an agent, look for security schemes in the output. If the agent has no security requirements, you can interact freely. Otherwise:

**No auth required:**
```
Security: None required
```
→ Proceed directly with `send` or `stream`.

**API Key required:**
```
Security Schemes:
  "api_key": API Key (header: X-API-Key)
```
→ Ask the user for the API key, then:
```bash
a2a-ask send <url> -m "message" --api-key "user-provided-key" --api-key-header "X-API-Key"
```

**Bearer token required:**
```
Security Schemes:
  "bearer_auth": HTTP Bearer
```
→ Ask the user for their bearer token, then:
```bash
a2a-ask send <url> -m "message" --auth-token "user-provided-token"
```

**OAuth2 required:**
```
Security Schemes:
  "oauth2": OAuth2 (device code flow available)
```
→ Run the interactive login first:
```bash
a2a-ask auth login <url>
```
This will display a device code and verification URL. Ask the user to visit the URL and enter the code. Once authenticated, the token is stored and subsequent commands will use it automatically.

**Custom headers:**
For non-standard auth mechanisms, use:
```bash
a2a-ask send <url> -m "message" --auth-header "X-Custom-Auth=secret-value"
```

### Auth Decision Tree

Follow this logic when an agent requires authentication:

1. Check the agent card's security schemes (from `discover` output)
2. If **API Key** → ask the user for the key → pass via `--api-key`
3. If **HTTP Bearer** → ask the user for a token → pass via `--auth-token`
4. If **OAuth2 with device code** → run `a2a-ask auth login <url>` → interactive flow
5. If **OpenID Connect** → extract the issuer URL, guide user to obtain a token, pass via `--auth-token`
6. If **auth-required** state returned mid-task → obtain credentials and retry the same task with `--task-id` and auth options

## Streaming vs Polling

### When to Use Streaming

If the agent card's capabilities indicate streaming is supported, prefer `a2a-ask stream` over `a2a-ask send`. Streaming provides:
- Real-time status updates as the agent works
- Partial results as they become available
- Better user experience for long-running tasks

```bash
a2a-ask stream <url> -m "Analyze this data" --output text
```

In text mode, streaming renders status updates like:
```
[working] Analyzing data...
[working] Processing results...
[completed] Done!
```

### When to Use Polling

If the agent doesn't support streaming, or you used `send` with `--return-immediately`:

1. Send the initial message:
```bash
a2a-ask send <url> -m "Long running task" --return-immediately
```

2. Note the `task-id` from the response.

3. Poll for status (start at 2-second intervals, back off to 5 seconds):
```bash
a2a-ask task get <url> --task-id <id>
```

4. Continue polling until the state is terminal: `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`, or `input-required`.

### Subscribing to Task Events

If you already have a task ID and want to watch for updates via streaming:

```bash
a2a-ask stream <url> --task-id <task-id> --subscribe
```

## Working with Files and Data

### Sending Files

Include a file with your message:

```bash
a2a-ask send <url> -m "Summarize this document" --file ./report.pdf
```

### Sending Structured Data

Send JSON data as a message part:

```bash
a2a-ask send <url> -d '{"key": "value", "items": [1, 2, 3]}'
```

### Saving Artifact Files

When the agent returns file artifacts (images, documents, etc.), save them to disk:

```bash
a2a-ask send <url> -m "Generate a chart" --save-artifacts ./output/
```

## Common Patterns

### Simple Question → Answer

```bash
a2a-ask discover https://agent.example.com/weather --output text
a2a-ask send https://agent.example.com/weather -m "What's the weather in Seattle?"
```

### Streaming Conversation with Follow-ups

```bash
# Initial request
a2a-ask stream https://agent.example.com/assistant -m "Help me plan a trip to Japan"

# Agent responds with questions (input-required state) — note the task-id
# Send follow-up
a2a-ask stream https://agent.example.com/assistant -m "2 weeks in April, interested in history and food" --task-id <task-id>
```

### Discovering and Calling an Unknown Agent

When the user provides an agent URL you haven't seen before:

```bash
# Step 1: Always discover first
a2a-ask discover <url> --output text --pretty

# Step 2: Review capabilities, skills, and security requirements
# Step 3: Handle authentication if needed
# Step 4: Send a message appropriate to the agent's skills
a2a-ask send <url> -m "request matching the agent's described skills"
```

### Working with a Secured Agent

```bash
# Discover and see security requirements
a2a-ask discover https://secure-agent.example.com --output text

# If OAuth2 device code:
a2a-ask auth login https://secure-agent.example.com
# → Follow the interactive flow, user visits URL and enters code

# Now send messages (token is stored)
a2a-ask send https://secure-agent.example.com -m "Secured request"
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

| Error | Likely Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Connection refused / timeout | Agent is down or URL is wrong | Verify the URL, try `discover` first |
| 401 Unauthorized | Missing or invalid auth | Check security requirements with `discover`, provide correct credentials |
| 404 Not Found | Wrong endpoint URL | Verify the agent URL, check if well-known path is correct |
| Empty response `{}` | Protocol version mismatch | The CLI auto-negotiates v0.3/v1.0 — if this persists, the agent may have issues |
| `input-required` state | Agent needs more info | Read the agent's question, send a follow-up with `--task-id` |
| `auth-required` state | Auth needed mid-task | Obtain credentials, retry with auth options and `--task-id` |
| `failed` state | Agent processing error | Read the error message in the response, adjust request and retry |

### Verbose Mode

For debugging, add `-v` to any command to see detailed request/response information:

```bash
a2a-ask send <url> -m "test" -v
```

## Global Options

These options are available on all commands:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--output <json\|text>` | Output format | `json` |
| `--pretty` | Pretty-print JSON output | `false` |
| `-v, --verbose` | Verbose/debug output | `false` |

**Use `--output json`** (default) when parsing output programmatically.
**Use `--output text`** when displaying results to a user for readability.

## A2A Protocol Quick Reference

### What is A2A?

A2A (Agent-to-Agent) is an open protocol that allows AI agents to communicate with each other over HTTP. Key concepts:

- **Agent Card** — JSON metadata describing an agent's capabilities, skills, and security requirements. Published at a well-known URL.
- **Message** — A communication unit containing one or more Parts (text, files, data).
- **Task** — A stateful unit of work created when a message is sent to an agent. Has a lifecycle with states.
- **Artifact** — Output produced by the agent (text, files, structured data).
- **Part** — A content unit within a message or artifact: text, raw bytes (file), URL reference, or structured data.

### Task States

```
           ┌─────────────────────────────┐
           │                             ▼
 submitted → working → completed
                │         │
                │         ├→ failed
                │         │
                │         └→ canceled
                │
                └→ input-required (waiting for user input)
                │
                └→ auth-required (waiting for credentials)
```

### Protocol Versions

- **v1.0** — Current version with `supportedInterfaces`, discriminated unions, structured types
- **v0.3** — Older version still used by many agents — the CLI handles both transparently

The CLI automatically detects the agent's protocol version and communicates accordingly. You don't need to specify the version manually.

## Limitations

1. **OAuth2 authorization code flow** — Only device code flow is supported interactively. For auth code flow, obtain the token externally and pass via `--auth-token`.
2. **mTLS** — Mutual TLS authentication is not yet supported.
3. **Push notifications** — The CLI cannot receive push notifications (it's a client, not a server). Use streaming or polling instead.
4. **Token refresh** — Stored tokens are not automatically refreshed. If a token expires, re-run `auth login`.
5. **Binary output in JSON mode** — File artifacts are base64-encoded inline. Use `--save-artifacts` for large files.
