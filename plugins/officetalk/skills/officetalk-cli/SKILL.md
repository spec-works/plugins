# OfficeTalk CLI — Scripted Office Document Editing

Apply deterministic, repeatable operations to Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) using a human-readable, LLM-friendly grammar.

OfficeTalk is a structured document format (`application/officetalk`, file extension `.otk`) that describes precise modifications to Office documents. The CLI tool parses `.otk` files, validates them, resolves addresses against target documents, and applies operations using the Office Open XML SDK.

## Prerequisites — Installing .NET

The OfficeTalk CLI requires .NET 9.0 or later. Install the SDK for your platform:

### Windows

```powershell
# Using winget (recommended)
winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.9

# Or download from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0
```

### macOS

```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install dotnet-sdk

# Or download from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0
```

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/24.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-9.0
```

### Linux (Fedora/RHEL)

```bash
sudo dnf install dotnet-sdk-9.0
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
dotnet --version
# Should show 9.x.x or later
```

## Installing the CLI Tool

```bash
dotnet tool install --global SpecWorks.OfficeTalk.CLI
```

Verify it works:

```bash
officetalk version
```

## OfficeTalk Document Format

An OfficeTalk document (`.otk` file) is a UTF-8 text file with a line-oriented grammar. Every document starts with a version header and document type, followed by operation blocks.

### Document Structure

```
OFFICETALK/1.0
DOCTYPE word|excel|powerpoint

# Comments start with #

AT <address>
<OPERATION> [arguments]
<OPERATION> [arguments]

AT <address>
<OPERATION> [arguments]
```

### Document Types

| DOCTYPE | Target | File Extension |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| `word` | Word documents | .docx |
| `excel` | Excel workbooks | .xlsx |
| `powerpoint` | PowerPoint presentations | .pptx |

## Addressing

Addresses are `/`-separated paths that locate content within an Office document. They use a simplified syntax — no XML namespaces, no Open XML internals.

### Path Segments

#### Word

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `body` | Document body |
| `paragraph` | A paragraph |
| `heading` | A paragraph with a heading style |
| `run` | A text run within a paragraph |
| `table` | A table |
| `row` | A table row |
| `cell` | A table cell |
| `list` | A list |
| `item` | A list item |
| `image` | An inline or anchored image |
| `section` | A document section |
| `header` | Page header |
| `footer` | Page footer |
| `bookmark` | A named bookmark |
| `content-control` | A structured document tag |

#### Excel

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sheet` | A worksheet |
| `range` | A cell range |
| `column` | A column |
| `row` | A table row |
| `cell` | A single cell |

#### PowerPoint

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `slide` | A slide |
| `shape` | A shape on a slide |
| `title` | Title placeholder |
| `subtitle` | Subtitle placeholder |
| `notes` | Speaker notes |

### Predicates

Predicates filter elements and go in square brackets after a segment.

#### Positional (1-based)

```
paragraph[3]              # third paragraph
table[1]/row[2]           # second row of first table
slide[5]                  # fifth slide
```

#### Key-Value

```
heading[level=2]                      # H2 heading
heading[level=2, text="Background"]   # specific H2 by text
table[caption="Results"]              # table by caption
sheet["Revenue"]                      # sheet by name (shorthand)
shape[name="Logo"]                    # shape by name
header[type=default]                  # default page header
content-control[tag="author-name"]    # content control by tag
```

#### Text Matching

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `text="..."` | Exact match | `paragraph[text="Hello World"]` |
| `text~="..."` | Regex match (I-Regexp) | `paragraph[text~="^Chapter \d+"]` |
| `text^="..."` | Starts with | `paragraph[text^="In conclusion"]` |
| `text$="..."` | Ends with | `paragraph[text$="respectively."]` |
| `text*="..."` | Contains | `paragraph[text*="important"]` |

#### Disambiguating Multiple Matches

```
paragraph[text*="revenue"][2]    # second paragraph containing "revenue"
```

### Address Examples

```
# Word
body/paragraph[1]
body/heading[level=1]
body/heading[level=2, text="Methods"]
body/paragraph[text*="conclusion"]
body/table[1]/row[3]/cell[2]
body/table[caption="Results"]/row[1]
body/bookmark["references"]
header[type=default]

# Excel
sheet["Revenue"]/B7
sheet["Revenue"]/A1:D10
sheet[1]/row[5]

# PowerPoint
slide[1]/title
slide[3]/shape[name="Chart1"]
slide[2]/notes
```

## Operations

### Content Operations

#### SET — Replace element content

```
AT body/paragraph[3]
SET "New paragraph text."

AT body/paragraph[3]
SET <<<
This paragraph now contains
multiple lines of text.
>>>
```

#### REPLACE — Find and replace text

```
AT body/paragraph[1]
REPLACE "FY2024" WITH "FY2025"

# Replace all occurrences
AT body
REPLACE ALL "colour" WITH "color"
```

#### INSERT BEFORE / INSERT AFTER — Add sibling content

```
AT body/heading[text="Conclusion"]
INSERT BEFORE <<<
Recommendations

Based on the findings presented in this report, we recommend:

1. Increase investment in renewable energy.
2. Expand the remote work program.
>>>

AT body/paragraph[1]
INSERT AFTER "A new paragraph after the first one."
```

#### DELETE — Remove an element

```
AT body/paragraph[text*="DRAFT"]
DELETE
```

#### APPEND / PREPEND — Add to existing content

```
AT body/paragraph[1]
APPEND " (see Appendix A)"

AT sheet["Notes"]/A1
PREPEND "UPDATED: "
```

### Formatting Operations

#### FORMAT — Apply formatting properties

```
AT body/paragraph[1]
FORMAT bold=true, font-size=14pt, color=#2B579A

AT body/heading[level=1]
FORMAT font-name="Aptos Display", font-size=28pt
FORMAT color=#1F3864, spacing-after=12pt
```

When FORMAT follows a content operation in the same block, it formats the produced content:

```
AT body/heading[text="Summary"]
INSERT AFTER "Key Findings"
FORMAT bold=true, font-size=16pt
```

#### STYLE — Apply a named style

```
AT body/paragraph[5]
STYLE "Heading 2"

AT body/table[1]
STYLE "Grid Table 4 - Accent 1"
```

### Structural Operations

#### Table Operations

```
AT body/table[1]/row[3]
INSERT ROW AFTER
SET CELLS "Product D", "450", "12%", "Active"

AT body/table[1]/row[5]
DELETE ROW

AT body/table[1]/row[2]/cell[1]
MERGE CELLS TO row[2]/cell[3]
```

#### Slide Operations (PowerPoint)

```
AT slide[3]
INSERT SLIDE AFTER
SET title "New Section"
SET subtitle "Overview of Changes"

AT slide[5]
DELETE SLIDE

AT slide[3]
DUPLICATE SLIDE
```

#### Sheet Operations (Excel)

```
ADD SHEET "Summary"

AT sheet["Old Name"]
RENAME SHEET "New Name"
```

### Metadata Operations

```
PROPERTY title="Quarterly Report Q1 2026"
PROPERTY author="Finance Team"
```

## Bulk Operations with AT EACH

Use `AT EACH` to apply operations to all matching elements:

```
AT EACH body/paragraph[text*="TODO"]
FORMAT highlight=#FFFF00, bold=true

AT EACH body/heading[level=2]
FORMAT color=#2B579A
```

**Important:** `AT EACH` requires at least one match — zero matches is an error. Use it for bulk formatting, styling, and replacement. Exercise caution with destructive operations like DELETE.

## Data Types

| Type | Examples |
|------|---------|
| Strings | `"Hello"`, `"She said \"hi\""`, `"Line 1\nLine 2"` |
| Numbers | `42`, `3.14`, `-7` |
| Booleans | `true`, `false` |
| Colors | `#2B579A`, `#FF0000`, `red`, `cornflowerblue` |
| Lengths | `12pt`, `1.5in`, `2.54cm`, `50%`, `914400emu` |
| Content blocks | `<<<` ... `>>>` (multi-line text, each on its own line) |

## Formatting Properties Reference

### Text Properties

`font-name`, `font-size`, `bold`, `italic`, `underline` (single/double/dotted/dashed/wavy/none), `strikethrough`, `color`, `highlight`, `superscript`, `subscript`, `small-caps`, `all-caps`

### Paragraph Properties

`alignment` (left/center/right/justify), `spacing-before`, `spacing-after`, `line-spacing`, `indent-left`, `indent-right`, `indent-first-line`, `indent-hanging`, `keep-with-next`, `page-break-before`

### Table/Cell Properties

`width`, `alignment`, `border`, `border-color`, `border-width`, `cell-padding`, `fill-color`, `vertical-align`, `wrap-text`, `number-format`

### Image Properties

`width`, `height`, `alt`, `position` (inline/anchor)

## Processing Model — Snapshot Semantics

**Critical concept:** All addresses are resolved against the original document BEFORE any operations are applied. This means:

- `paragraph[5]` always refers to the fifth paragraph in the original document
- Operations that insert or delete elements do NOT shift indices for later blocks
- Every block operates on the document as it existed before any modifications

This makes OfficeTalk documents safe to produce — the author reasons about the current state of the document, not a partially-modified intermediate state.

## CLI Commands

### `officetalk apply` — Execute .otk against a document

```bash
# Apply changes in-place
officetalk apply -i changes.otk -t report.docx

# Write to a new file
officetalk apply -i changes.otk -t report.docx -o report-updated.docx

# Dry run — validate and resolve without modifying
officetalk apply -i changes.otk -t report.docx --dry-run

# Verbose output
officetalk apply -i changes.otk -t report.docx -v

# Pipe OfficeTalk from stdin
echo "OFFICETALK/1.0
DOCTYPE word
AT body/heading[1]
SET \"Updated Title\"" | officetalk apply -t report.docx
```

| Option | Alias | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--input` | `-i` | Path to .otk file (or pipe via stdin) |
| `--target` | `-t` | Target Office document (required) |
| `--output` | `-o` | Output path (default: modify in-place) |
| `--force` | — | Overwrite output if exists |
| `--dry-run` | — | Validate without applying |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Show detailed operation log |

### `officetalk validate` — Check .otk for errors

```bash
# Syntax-only validation (no target doc needed)
officetalk validate -i changes.otk --syntax-only

# Full validation with semantic checks
officetalk validate -i changes.otk -t report.docx

# Machine-readable JSON output
officetalk validate -i changes.otk -f json
```

| Option | Alias | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--input` | `-i` | Path to .otk file (required) |
| `--target` | `-t` | Target document for semantic validation |
| `--syntax-only` | — | Skip semantic validation |
| `--format` | `-f` | Output format: `text` (default) or `json` |

### `officetalk parse` — Dump AST as JSON

```bash
officetalk parse -i changes.otk
officetalk parse -i changes.otk --pretty
```

### `officetalk inspect` — Explore addresses

```bash
# See what an address resolves to
officetalk inspect -t report.docx -a "body/heading[level=1]"

# With surrounding context
officetalk inspect -t report.docx -a "body/paragraph[text*='revenue']" -c 2
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Runtime/IO error |
| 2 | Parse or validation error |
| 3 | Address resolution failure |

## Writing OfficeTalk Documents — Best Practices

### 1. Always Start with Header

Every `.otk` file must begin with exactly:
```
OFFICETALK/1.0
DOCTYPE word
```
(Replace `word` with `excel` or `powerpoint` as needed.)

### 2. Use Comments to Document Intent

```
# Fix the typo reported in issue #42
AT body/paragraph[text*="teh company"]
REPLACE "teh" WITH "the"
```

### 3. Prefer Text Predicates Over Positional

Text-based addresses are more robust — they survive document edits:
```
# Good — survives if paragraphs are added/removed above
AT body/heading[text="Conclusion"]

# Fragile — breaks if document structure changes
AT body/heading[5]
```

### 4. Use Specific Addresses

Be as specific as possible to avoid ambiguity errors:
```
# Good — specific
AT body/heading[level=2, text="Methods"]

# Risky — may match multiple H2 headings
AT body/heading[level=2]
```

### 5. Group Related Changes

Put related formatting in the same block:
```
AT body/heading[level=1]
SET "Annual Report — FY2026"
FORMAT font-size=28pt, color=#1F3864
STYLE "Title"
```

### 6. Use Content Blocks for Multi-line Text

```
AT body/paragraph[text="placeholder"]
SET <<<
First paragraph of the new content.

Second paragraph, separated by a blank line.
This continues the second paragraph.
>>>
```

### 7. Use AT EACH for Bulk Operations

```
# Highlight all TODO markers
AT EACH body/paragraph[text*="TODO"]
FORMAT highlight=#FFFF00

# Restyle all H2 headings
AT EACH body/heading[level=2]
FORMAT color=#2B579A, font-size=18pt
```

### 8. Validate Before Applying

```bash
# Always validate first, especially for LLM-generated .otk files
officetalk validate -i changes.otk -t report.docx
# If exit code 0, safe to apply
officetalk apply -i changes.otk -t report.docx
```

## Limitations — What OfficeTalk Cannot Do

1. **No code execution** — OfficeTalk is purely declarative; no formulas, macros, or scripts
2. **No external references** — content blocks are literal text only; no URL fetching or file includes
3. **No image insertion** — cannot embed new images (can modify existing image properties)
4. **No chart creation** — charts must exist in the document already
5. **No template application** — cannot apply .dotx/.potx templates
6. **Excel/PowerPoint support is partial** — Word documents have the most complete implementation
7. **FORMAT operation** — not all formatting properties are implemented yet
8. **INSERT BEFORE/AFTER** — currently stubbed in the execution engine
9. **Structural operations** — INSERT ROW/COLUMN, MERGE CELLS are not yet implemented

## Composing with Other Tools

```bash
# Convert markdown to Word, then apply OfficeTalk edits
markmyword convert -i doc.md -o doc.docx && officetalk apply -i polish.otk -t doc.docx

# Generate an .otk file with an LLM, validate, then apply
llm "Fix all typos" --format officetalk > fixes.otk
officetalk validate -i fixes.otk -t report.docx && officetalk apply -i fixes.otk -t report.docx

# Validate OfficeTalk scripts in CI
for f in scripts/*.otk; do officetalk validate -i "$f" --syntax-only; done
```
